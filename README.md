# Opensea_Bot-tracker
Made a bot that track's wallets on opensea, it tracks the sales and listings of the NFT's by the wallet you can constantly change.

Notes: I did not had the API key to work with API on this, so i scraped, in order to scrap i used selenium which is a web driver you got to install,
       Did not include the section of code w integration to discord bot, this is just to retrieve data, by tracking a specified wallet
